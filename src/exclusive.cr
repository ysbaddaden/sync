  # `Mutex`, so only one critical section can access the value at any time.
  #
  # For example:
  #
  # ```
  # require "sync/exclusive"
  #
  # class Queue
  #   @@running : Sync::Exclusive.new([] of Queue)
  #
  #   def self.on_started(queue)
  #     @@running.own(&.push(queue))
  #   end
  #
  #   def self.on_stopped(queue)
  #     @@running.own(&.delete(queue))
  #   end
  #
  #   def self.each(&)
  #     @@running.own do |list|
  #       list.each { |queue| yield queue }
  #     end
  #   end
  # end
  # ```
  #
  # Consider an `Exclusive(T)` if your workload mostly needs to own the value,
  # and most, if not all, critical sections need to mutate the inner state of
  # the value for example.
