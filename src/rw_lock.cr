module Sync
  # A multiple readers and exclusive writer lock to protect critical sections.
  #
  # Multiple fibers can acquire the shared lock (read) to allow some critical
  # sections to run concurrently. However a single fiber can acquire the
  # exclusive lock at a time to protect a single critical section to ever run in
  # parallel. When the lock has been acquired in exclusive mode, no other fiber
  # can lock it, be it in shared or exclusive mode.
  #
  # For example, the shared mode can allow to read one or many resources, albeit
  # the resources must be safe to be accessed in such manner, while the
  # exclusive mode allows to safely replace or mutate the resources with the
  # guarantee that nothing else is accessing said resources.
  #
  # The implementation doesn't favor readers or writers in particular.
  #
  # NOTE: Consider `Shared(T)` to protect a value `T` with a `RWLock`.
